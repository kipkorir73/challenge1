## CHALLENGE 3
You are given a lowercase string containing only alphabetic characters and no spaces. Your task is to return the highest value of consonant substrings in the string. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou". Each consonant has a corresponding value: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, ..., z = 26.

You need to find all consonant substrings in the string and calculate their values. The highest value among these consonant substrings should be returned.
